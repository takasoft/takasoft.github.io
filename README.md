## Quick start

### Step 1) Fork this theme to your user repository

Fork this repository, then rename the repository to your-username.github.io or your favorite name.

### Step 2) Enable Github Pages

Go to `Settings --> Github Pages --> Source`

Choose `master branch` and enable Github Pages.

Your Jekyll blog will be viewable at <http://your-username.github.io> or <http://your-username.github.io/your-favorite-name>.

### Step 2) Customize and view your site

Edit site info by editing the `_config.yml` file. 
Change `baseurl` to your repository's name.
If it is your-username.github.io then set it empty.

> There are 2 different ways that you can make changes to your blog's files:

> 1. Edit files within your new repository in the browser at gitHub.com (easiest).
> 2. Clone down your repository and make updates locally, then push them to your GitHub repository.

### Step 3) Publish your first blog post

Go to `/_posts/` and create a markdown file in this format: `year-month-day-title.md` to publish your first blog post. 

### Some manual setups

- You have to create `<new category name>.html` with the following content in the `category` folder when you create a new category.

```markdown
---
layout: category
title: new category name
category: new-category-name
---
```    

## Local Development

```shell
gem install jekyll bundler
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
