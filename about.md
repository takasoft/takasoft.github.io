Hello. Thank you for visiting my page!

My name is Takao Shibamoto and I'm an international student from Japan who lives in Iowa, USA. Innovation and diversity are something that excites me, so here I am.

I am pursuing B.S. in Computer Engineering with a minor in Cyber Security at Iowa State University. 

I love creating software that is useful and practical. I am a careful thinker about cyber security and privacy. 

Outside of my study, I create my own software like <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=TakaSoft&hl=en" target="_blank">Android Apps</a>, participate in <a href="https://devpost.com/takao-shibamoto" target="_blank">hackathons</a> with my friends, and enjoy solving <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/takasoft" target="_blank">data science problems</a> and competitive programming problems.

Other than that, I'm a huge <a href="https://www.quora.com/profile/Takao-Shibamoto" target="_blank">Quora addict</a>. Recently I've been addicted to translating interesting English questions/answers to Japanese.

Please see my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/takao-shibamoto" target="_blank">LinkedIn profile</a> for my most updated resume. I am actively looking for a software engineering role upon graduation in December 2019.

### Professional Experience

**Software Engineering Intern (Network Security)**<br>
<i class="fa fa-briefcase"></i> PayPal, SanJose, California<br>
<i class="fa fa-calendar"></i> May 2018 – August 2018 and May 2019 – August 2019

I worked in the Corporate Network Security Automation team. My work focused on the very first part of the firewall administration called ticketing where employees submit firewall rule requests. I have developed a web application that users can go to more efficiently create a request utilizing a firewall automation tool on the backend. The application successfuly decreased the waiting time of the user by 3-5x.

Here, I met so many wonderful people who are passionate about their work. It was my pleasure to work at PayPal.

### Research Experience at Iowa State

**Software Research Assistant**<br>
<i class="fa fa-calendar"></i> May 2017 – May 2018

During this research experience I developed several bioinformatics applications with <a href="https://twitter.com/gokool4bioinfo" target="_blank">a graduate student</a> at <a href="https://vollbrechtlab.gdcb.iastate.edu/personnel/" target="_blank">Vollbrecht Lab</a>, most notably a PCR primer design web application called [Primer Server](https://github.com/vollbrechtlab/primer-server) (Python, Angular). At the end of this research, I [made presentation](https://takasoft.github.io/ncur-primer-server) at National Conferences on Undergraduate Research.

**Independent Study - Plant Breeding**<br>
<i class="fa fa-calendar"></i> Jan 2017 - May 2017

This was my very first research experience where I learned about how to develop an efficient algorithm. First I converted the optimized Matlab code written by <a href="https://www.imse.iastate.edu/directory/lizhi-wang/" target="_blank">Dr. Lizhi Wang</a>. I learned a smart way of processing genome data using matrix transformations by reading his code. Then I developed a GUI tool to simulate genomic selection: [Genomic Selection Simulator](https://github.com/takasoft/GenomicSelectionSimulator). 


### Leadership Experience

**Lab Teaching Assistant - Embedded Systems**<br>
<i class="fa fa-calendar"></i> August 2018 – December 2018

I supported students in learning embedded C programming in [CPRE 288](http://class.ece.iastate.edu/cpre288/) lab.

**Academic Tutor - Digital Logic**<br>
<i class="fa fa-calendar"></i> January 2018 – May 2018

I taught concepts such as boolean algebra, finite state machine, and designs of simple computers to groups of 5 tutees in CPRE281. It was interesting to interact with students with all kinds of levels. It also gave me deeper understanding of the subject.

### Skills

- Languages: Python, JavaScript, SQL, C/C++, Java.
- Tools/Frameworks: Linux, Flask, Angular, NetSec device APIs, Docker, Hadoop/Spark.
- Hobby: Piano, Shogi (Japanese Chess), Playing/programming video games.
