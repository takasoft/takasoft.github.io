A HackISU fall 2017 project: Care Taker

We thought about making something that would influence the community, and we were looking to focus on health particularly. Imagine a patient with a forgetful memory; they might have to take some specific pills. This project Makes sure that they do that and that the doctor knows and tells them to take it.

We got a best use of Internet of Things prize from Major League Hacking for this project!
