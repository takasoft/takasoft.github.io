I presented a poster about Primer Server at <a href="https://www.cur.org/conferences_and_events/student_events/ncur_2018/" target="_blank">the National Conferences on Undergraduate Research</a> at University of Central Oklahoma last week.

You can see our research's abstract <a href="https://ncurdb.cur.org/ncur2018/search/Display_NCUR.aspx?id=107828" target="_blank">here</a>. I'm on <a href="https://news.engineering.iastate.edu/2018/03/30/seventeen-engineering-students-to-present-at-national-undergrad-research-conference/" target="_blank">the university news</a> as well! 

Primer Server is a web application to design PCR primer with a user-friendly GUI. This is the project I am currently working on at Vollbrecht Lab, ISU. 

PCR is a laboratory technique to amplify a specific part of DNA/RNA. A primer is a short strand of DNA/RNA that serves as a starting point for DNA replication. Two primers (left and right) are used since PCR happens from both ways. 

Being able to amplify a specific part of DNA/RNA means that researchers can find infection such as AIDS or they can transport the specific feature of one living organism to another to increase disease resistance.

There were 4000+ participants of students, faculty and university staff from all over the country.

It was a truely facinating experience to talk to various presenters and widen my perspective.

The source code is up on <a href="https://github.com/vollbrechtlab/primer-server" target="_blank">our GitHub repo</a>.

Here is the actual poster I presented. Click image to download.
