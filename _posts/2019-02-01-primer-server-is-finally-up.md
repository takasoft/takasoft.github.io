I'm excited to announce that Primer Server we developed at Vollbrecht Lab is finally up on the oficial site.

<a href="https://primer-server.gdcb.iastate.edu" target="_blank">primer-server.gdcb.iastate.edu</a>

It was a facinating experience to contribute to the state-of-art bioinfomatics research in some meaningful way.

Please see <a href="https://takasoft.github.io/ncur-primer-server" target="_blank">this post</a> for details of Primer Server.

The source code is up on <a href="https://github.com/vollbrechtlab/primer-server" target="_blank">our GitHub repo</a>.
