This is one of plant genome research project I did with Gokul, a bioinformatics PhD candidate at ISU Vollbrecht Lab.
This Google sheet add-on generates a sample list and rack labels for field sample collection. The reason we developed this add-on is that there was a decade old excel macro that did this task. However this macro no longer works on new versions of Windows. Gokul came up with the idea of making this tool work on a cloud platform. I developed most of the backend and frontend.
This add-on is used by several genome researchers across the nation.
I learned AppScript which is a superset of JavaScript used for writing Google add-ons throughout this project.

### Description

This add-on arranges a collection of samples into an 8 x 12 (96 well) array and creates labeled, hard-copy plate maps for sample collection into a standard, 96-well format rack.

The input is a short list of samples consisting of group names (e.g., plot numbers) and the number of samples (e.g., plants) per group. The output assigns to each sample an ordered ID that incorporates the group name, an address in an 8 x 12 (96-well) array, a unique ID for the 96-well array, and enters the information into three output sheets: (1) The Sample List is an expanded sheet that lists all of the samples individually and their corresponding plate address.  (2 and 3) The There are 2 worksheets with rack labels (plate maps), one for notes and one formatted for printing to fit over a 2.1 ml deep-well 96 hole plate. Once the plate map is fitted to the deep-well plate, sample tubes are pushed through their labeled positions in the paper map as they are collected, which minimizes tracking errors.

The generated sample maps are used like this in the field research.
